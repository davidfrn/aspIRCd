     +n     - No external messages. Only channel members may talk in
              the channel.
     +t     - Ops Topic. Only opped (+o) users may set the topic.

              ops are necessary).
     +Q     - Disable forward. Users cannot be forwarded to the channel
              (however, new forwards can still be set subject to +F).
     +C     - Disable CTCP. All CTCP messages to the channel, except ACTION,
              are disallowed.

              PARAMS: /mode #channel +j count:time

              PARAMS: /mode #channel +k key

              PARAMS: /mode #channel +v nick
     +h     - Half-op. Allows a user to talk in an +m channel, and to do what
              an op may do to a non-operator. Notation varies depending on
              server configuration. Halfops might have reduced powers to
              change modes.
              PARAMS: /mode #channel +h nick
     +o     - Op. Allows a user generic control over the channel.
              PARAMS: /mode #channel +o nick
     +a     - Super-op. The second highest rank, super-op allows a user the
              ability to kick users with the same rank, as well as all of the
              privileges of +o. This type of op is immune to kicks from +o,
              but +w/+W are immune to kicks from +a.
              PARAMS: /mode #channel +a nick
   +w/+W    - Owner/ownerbot (semantics vary per channel and server config)
              Tied for the highest rank, manager and owner, or owner and
              ownerbot on some networks and channels, are ops who cannot be
              kicked by regular ops nor superops, but only their own kind.
              If both are enabled, +W shows higher in the nick list.
              PARAMS: /mode #channel +w nick
                      /mode #channel +W nick
     +b     - Ban. Prevents a user from entering the channel, and from
              sending or changing nick if they are on it, based on a 
              nick!ident@host match, or extended matches.
              PARAMS: /mode #channel +b nick!user@host
     +q     - Quiet. Prevents a user from sending to the channel or changing
              nick, based on a nick!ident@host match.

     +e     - Exempt. Allows a user to join a channel and send to it even if
              they are banned (+b) or quieted (+q), based on a nick!ident@host

              PARAMS: /mode #channel +e nick!user@host
     +I     - Invite Exempt. Allows a user to join a +i channel without an
