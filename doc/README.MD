## CONFIGURATION

1) **example.conf** Be sure to first refer to reference.conf for the explanation of each and every clause, and then edit example.conf
Rename `YOUR DIRECTORY/etc/example.conf` to `YOUR DIRECTORY/etc/ircd.conf`

2) **opers.conf** Do **NOT** forget to EDIT `YOUR DIRECTORY/etc/opers.conf` according to your suitable needs.
The password is protected in a suitable hash when in case your server gets hacked by someone, they wont know your O:line passwords.
Make sure to not to use same passwords everywhere, if you are doing that, you are in great trouble.
Protect your passwords , as you know **aspIRCd** passwords are case sensitive , so : FOR EG: If you want your password to be `Cheese`
then encrypt it to `ch3s3e`

These two sets of configuration file are the most basic and **important** sets of your Network.
Make sure to edit them patiently.

Have cheers,
